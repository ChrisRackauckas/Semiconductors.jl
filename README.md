This repository is the code behind the master's thesis
[TCAD-Informed Surrogate Models of Semiconductor Devices](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/144946)
by Sam Chinnery. The code is uploaded as-is from the state of 2022. No manifest is provided
and it would take some work to update this to the latest versions. This is open sourced
and shared for posterity.
